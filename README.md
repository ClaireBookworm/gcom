# G.COM

Welcome to G.com! It's the... lazy version of Google! 

If you are willing to work for your goals, congrats! But we have a little something for those who don't. This is mini-google, where you don't have to type too much to search. 

There also are no distractions, but you can access all the extras in the menu above. Literally, you don't need to type google.com but rather g.com. 

Isn't that so much better? The searches still go to google.
