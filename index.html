      <p><strong>Hello!</strong> Read below. Do they sound familiar?</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href = "https://www.google.com" title = "Google">Google.com</a> is literally your lifeline.</li>
        <li>You feel that typing google.com is too much.</li>
        <li>Your wifi is agonizingly slow, about a nanosecond slower than your friend, and you HAVE to be able to beat her at finding the answer to your homework question.</li>
      </ul>

    <div style = "color:#02193B">
      <p>If you answered yes to any of the situations above, then use G.com. Next time you need anything, just type g.com instead of google.com and you're all set! Look below for more instructions.</p>

      <p>If you are willing to work for your goals, congrats! But we have a little something for those who don't. This is <strong>mini-google</strong>, where you don't have to type too much to search. There also are no distractions, but you can access all the extras in the menu above. Literally, you don't need to type <a href = "https://www.google.com" title= "DO NOT CLICK">google.com</a> but rather <a href = "https://www.google.com" title="This is g.com">g.com</a>. Isn't that so much better? The searches still go to google.</p>
